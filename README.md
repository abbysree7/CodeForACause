CodeForACause
=============

"The most important thing a person can do is to help others have a better life". This app was developed for a hack-a-thon, "Code For A Cause" sponsored by Google, Oracle. 

This app is designed for students with ADHD to help them with their homework. The basic idea is to get them to focus on one work at a time and motivate them to finish it. The teachers have an interface in which they can give feedback and keep track of the students progress.

It is designed as a web app which could be moved to a mobile app. The technologies used for developing this app are Java, Javascript, Servlets and basic CSS. Time tracking was done by incorporating Google Calendar.

We faced so many problems because of the choice in technology. The Google calendar support for Javascript was very less and our mentor adviced us to switch over. We weren't left with enough time to complete it. I am planning to finish it in the near future :D 

Watch out for this app. It is already getting there.
